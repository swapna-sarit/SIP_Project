I couldnot convert it to standalone executables. Here are the dependencies required.
This only works in Windows, just because of the difference in filepath's directory separator of Windows and Linu file systems.



Softwares needed to be installed :
- Python3


Python3 packages needed to be installed :
- Pillow
- cv2 (opencv-python)
- math
- numpy


Instructions to run in command prompt after installing Python3 (and 'pip' package installer):
1. pip install Pillow
2. pip install opencv-python
3. pip install math
4. pip install numpy
5. python UI.py

Before carrying out step 5, navigate to containing folder using 'cd' command.
Step 5 would open the UI, which has further instructions on how to proceed.
NB: 1. The input image to the program needs to be 4 band image (although 3 band image works fine).
    2. Enter only integers (1/2/3/4) in the band-entry form
